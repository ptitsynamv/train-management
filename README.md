Angular 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Node v22.15.1, npm v10.9.2

## Development

1. Run `npm i`

2. To start a local development server, run `npm start`

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run `npm build`

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
